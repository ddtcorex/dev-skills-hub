# AI Skills Hub

A Claude Code plugin bundling Magento 2 and Govard skills. Every skill follows the
open [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) (a `SKILL.md` file with
`name`/`description` frontmatter), which Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, and
GitHub Copilot all understand — see [Installation](#-installation) for how to wire
this repo's `skills/` folder into each one, since they don't all scan the same
directory name.

This repository is built to be **fully extensible**, allowing you to continuously add new tech stacks, tools, and domain-specific skills over time.

---

## 📂 Directory Structure

Every skill lives under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — this is the layout Claude Code's
plugin loader requires, and it's the single source of truth (no other copy exists
anywhere else in the repo).

## ⚡ Extension Guide: Adding New Skills

You can easily expand this hub with any new programming language, framework, or utility domain (e.g., React, Python, Docker, CI/CD, AWS, etc.).

### Step 1: Create the Skill Folder
Create `skills/[domain]-[tool/stack]-[purpose]/` using kebab-case
(e.g., `skills/react-nextjs-tailwind/`, `skills/docker-ops-deployment/`).

### Step 2: Create a `SKILL.md` File
Every skill folder **must** contain a `SKILL.md` file at its root with valid YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: |
  Describe exactly when the AI Agent should trigger this skill.
  Make it descriptive and comprehensive so agents easily understand context.
compatibility: claude, codex, opencode, copilot
depends: [any-dependencies-if-applicable]
metadata:
  audience: developers
  workflow: your-workflow
---

# Your Skill Title

## Capabilities
Describe what this skill enables the agent to do.

## Best Practice Patterns
Provide code templates, standards, and typical commands.

## Verification
Step-by-step commands to verify output works properly.
```

> `compatibility`, `depends`, and `metadata` are custom conventions for cross-tool
> sharing — Claude Code's plugin schema ignores them (only `name` and
> `description` are required), so they're safe to keep.

### Step 3: Add to `README.md`
Add your new skill to the directory tree above and the compatibility matrix below.

## 🤖 Agent Compatibility Matrix

Content-format compatible with all four out of the box — actually loading a skill
still requires it to sit in the directory name that tool scans (see
[Installation](#-installation)).

## 💾 Installation

Every tool recognizes the same `SKILL.md` file, but each one scans its **own**
directory name — none of them can be pointed at an arbitrary folder like this
repo's bare `skills/`, so pick the option(s) below for the tools you use.

### Claude Code — as a plugin (recommended)
```
/plugin marketplace add ddtcorex/ai-skills
/plugin install ai-skills@ai-skills
```
Updates: `/plugin marketplace update ai-skills`.

### Direct use in your own project — one-line install/update

Each tool scans its own directory name, so `install.sh` clones this repo once
into `~/.ai-skills` and links each skill into every tool's expected path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddtcorex/ai-skills/master/install.sh | bash
```

Run interactively, it asks for scope (`project` = current directory, `personal`
= your home directory, available in every project) and which tools to target.
Re-running the exact same command later **is** the update — it re-pulls the
cache and re-links. Common flags for non-interactive/CI use:

```bash
curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- -y --scope project --target claude,codex \
  --skills magento2-dev-core,govard-toolbox --mode copy
curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- -y --uninstall
```

| Tool | Scans (project scope) | Scans (personal scope) |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/` (also checks `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`) | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` |
| Codex CLI | `.agents/skills/` **only** | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| GitHub Copilot / VS Code | `.github/skills/` (also checks `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, or a custom `chat.agentSkillsLocations` path) | `~/.copilot/skills/` |

`install.sh` creates each tool's own dedicated path (symlinked to the
`~/.ai-skills` cache by default, or real copies with `--mode copy`) rather than
relying on the secondary paths some tools also check, so `ls` in your project
shows exactly which tools have a copy.

> GitHub Copilot's older "Skillsets" feature (for Copilot Extensions — API tool
> integrations) is unrelated to the Agent Skills folders above; don't confuse the
> two when searching Copilot's docs.
